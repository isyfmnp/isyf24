        This Year's Theme:
        <PrimaryHighlight>
          Science and Technology for Humanity: Building a Sustainable Future
        </PrimaryHighlight>
      </h2>

      <p>
        The theme “Science and Technology for Humanity: Building a Sustainable
        Future” highlights the important role of science and technology in
        driving sustainable and inclusive development. It reflects the need for
        a holistic approach to science and technology, considering their
        benefits for humanity and their accompanying ethical considerations in
        addressing societal challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Responsible and ethical use of science and technology are essential to
        resolve pressing global challenges such as climate change, inequality
        and health disparities. At the same time, science and technology have
        the role of enhancing productivity in order to induce a dynamic
        transformation of the economy and increase growth rates. It is also
        important to consider the social, cultural, and ethical implications of
        scientific and technological advancements, and encourage discussions on
        how to mitigate potential negative impact and foster positive change
        through responsible innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The possibility of moving towards the free provision of technologies
        that contribute to meeting human challenges, making them accessible to
        all can be explored. In schools, the acquisition and dissemination of
        scientific knowledge, the building of innovation capabilities, and the
        push towards the collective goal of building a better world for future
        generations can be promoted. There is a pressing need for more
        conversations on the reform of policies and existing measures which can
        promote public interests in our pursuit of sustainability. If we are
        able to move forward, with each of us adopting a more sustainable
        lifestyle, we definitely can make the change and create an impact in not
        just our own country, but the world too.

      <h2>Our Goals</h2>

      <div class="goal red">
        <div>
          <h3>Inspire Passion for Science Among Youth</h3>
          <p>
            ISYF aims to provide students who are highly inquisitive and
            passionate about the sciences with ample opportunities to share and
            discuss their interest in Science, technology and scientific
            research. They will be exposed to many fields of science which will
            broaden their outlook and understanding of the scientific world.
            Invited Nobel laureates and eminent scientists will inspire them
            through stories of their own life experiences and scientific
            discoveries. These interactions will help create greater awareness
            among the youth about the importance of broad-based knowledge, fuel
            their curiosity, engender relentless tenacity and a global outlook
            when considering the pursuit of science as a meaningful and
            fulfilling endeavour.

            Establish Cooperation and Friendship Amongst Young Talented Science
            Students
          </h3>
          <p>
            Students will have many opportunities to interact in different
            cross-cultural groups and forge strong bonds with each other
            throughout the Forum. Activities are designed to promote mutual
            cooperation, understanding and appreciation of each other’s diverse
            cultures while sharing a common passion in science, technology and
            research.
