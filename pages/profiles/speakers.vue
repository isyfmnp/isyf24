          "F. Duncan M. Haldane, who shared the 2016  Nobel Prize for Physics with David Thouless and Michael Kosterlitz, is the  Sherman Fairchild University Professor of Physics at Princeton University, who is a Fellow of the Royal Society of  London, and  of  the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (foreign member)  He is also a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Physical Society. \n\nHe was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for his theoretical work on “topological states of matter”, including pioneering work on unexpected  (and initially controversial) “topological quantum states” of one-dimensional systems of magnetic atoms (for which he had previously received the 1993 Oliver Buckley Prize of the American Physical Society), and on the theoretical prediction of (ferromagnetic) topological insulators (exhibiting the “quantum anomalous Hall effect”, finally first observed experimentally  in 2013) for which he had shared the 2012 Dirac medal of the International Center for Theoretical Physics (Trieste) with Charles Kane and Shou-Cheng Zhang. His work helped to open up new directions and ways of thinking about quantum effects in condensed matter, and in recent years, “topological quantum matter” has grown into a very active experimental field which many believe may provide platforms for “quantum computing”.    He also initiated the field of “topological photonics”.   He currently works on “quantum geometry” in the “fractional quantum Hall effect”. \n\nHaldane received his Ph. D.  in theoretical condensed matter physics from Cambridge University, under the direction and mentorship of Philip W. Anderson (Nobel Laureate in Physics 1977), and, before his appointment at Princeton University, worked at the Institut Laue-Langevin (Grenoble, France), the University of Southern California,  Bell Laboratories, and the University of California, San Diego, in the U.S.A. Haldane was born in London in 1951, with mixed Scottish and Austrian/Slovenian origins, and was educated at St. Pauls school, then Christ’s College, Cambridge.",

        description:
          "“I don’t have a job, I have a hobby,” says Aaron Ciechanover, Distinguished Research Professor in the Faculty of Medicine at Technion – Israel Institute of Technology. Professor Ciechanover places strong emphasis on doing what one loves in a career and believes that it is never too late to pursue one’s passions. \n\nThis line of thinking was certainly shaped by Prof Ciechanover’s own experience. He is a physician by training, but his first love has always been biology and understanding the natural world. During his medical degree, he started to wonder about the mechanisms underlying diseases and realised that a physician’s role is limited to examining diseases after they have developed. Seeing science as the answer to his questions, he pivoted to research and has never looked back. \n\nIn many ways, Prof Ciechanover is grateful for his medical training because he felt that the field has enriched his scientific knowledge and contributed to his ability to understand and develop drugs to treat diseases. He joined Professor Avram Hershko’s laboratory as part of his internship requirement to obtain his medical license, and the two have collaborated closely ever since. \n\nProf Ciechanover, Prof Hershko and the late Professor Irwin Rose worked together to understand protein degradation. Proteins are in all living things and are constantly removed or replaced. Although researchers had figured out how cells produce various proteins, the mechanism to remove and recycle them was unknown at that time. \n\nFor their discovery of a small protein called ubiquitin that marks old proteins for destruction, Prof Ciechanover and his colleagues were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2004. Their seminal work advanced our understanding of cellular processes and disease formation as well as contributed to drug development. \n\nProf Ciechanover sees collaborations as fundamental in research, particularly when scientific fields like biology and physics have expanded tremendously since his days as a student. “You need to collaborate. The multiple hands that make the world these days are not an option anymore, they are essential,” he explains. \n\nHowever, Prof Ciechanover believes that successful collaborations rely on the individual expertise of each collaborator. He advises young scientists to focus on building their niche, knowledge and skills—in other words, to create demand for themselves and offer expertise that others will seek. \n\nHe also equates establishing a career in science to running a long marathon or climbing a mountain, both of which require resilience and patience. He advises budding scientists to see their struggles as progress, their mistakes as learning points and their successes as possibilities. “What I tell young people is this: what you see in front of you when you look at me is not a dream, it's reality. So materialise your own reality,” says Prof Ciechanover. \n\nProf Ciechanover is a member of many scientific academies, including the Israel National Academy of Sciences and Humanities, European Molecular Biology Organisation, American Academy of Arts and Sciences (as a Foreign Fellow), Chinese Academy of Sciences (as a Foreign Member) and Pontifical Academy of Sciences at the Vatican. Apart from the Nobel Prize, his awards include the 2000 Albert Lasker Award, the 2002 EMET Prize, the 2003 Israel Prize for Biology and the 2006 Sir Hans Krebs Medal.",

          "Tim Hunt grew up in Oxford, where he became fascinated by science at the Dragon School. At 14, he entered Magdalen College School, where his interest in biology grew. Tim entered Clare College, Cambridge in 1961 to read Natural Sciences. He joined the Department of Biochemistry in 1964 as a graduate student working on the control of haemoglobin synthesis. In 1968 he moved to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York as a postdoctoral Fellow with Irving London. \n\nTim returned to the Department of Biochemistry in Cambridge in 1971 where he continued to work on translational control throughout the 1970s. He taught summer courses at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, Massachusetts from 1977 to 1983, looking at changes in protein synthesis in sea urchin and clam eggs after fertilisation. In 1979, he helped Joan Ruderman and Eric Rosenthal with experiments on the translational control of maternal mRNA in clam eggs, where two of the major mRNAs concerned later turned out to be the A and B-type cyclins. By 1982, Tim had almost exhausted the potential of sea urchin eggs, but it was then that he performed the experiment that led to the discovery of cyclins and subsequent research on the control of the cell cycle. In 1990, Tim joined ICRF (now The Francis Crick Institute) in London. He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1991, a foreign associate of the US National Academy of Sciences in 1999 and shared the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine with Lee Hartwell and Paul Nurse in 2001. He enjoys cooking, photography and making up problems for Molecular Biology of the Cell with his friend John Wilson. In 2016, he and his wife Mary Collins moved to Okinawa, where Mary was the Provost of OIST (Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology). In 2022, Mary was appointed Director of the Blizard Institute of QMUL and they returned to London.",

          "Dr. Richard J. Roberts is the Chief Scientific Officer at New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Massachusetts.  He received a Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry in 1968 from Sheffield University and then moved as a postdoctoral fellow to Harvard.  From 1972 to 1992, he worked at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, eventually becoming Assistant Director for Research under Dr. J.D. Watson.  He began work on the newly discovered Type II restriction enzymes in 1972 and his laboratory discovered more than 70% of the first 100 enzymes described. In 1975 he became the fourth employee of New England Biolabs first as their chief consultant and later moved to the company permanently in 1992.  Studies of transcription in Adenovirus-2 led to the discovery of split genes and mRNA splicing in 1977, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1993. During the sequencing of the Adenovirus-2 genome, computational tools became essential and his laboratory pioneered the application of computers in this area.  DNA methyltransferases, as components of restriction-modification systems are also of active interest and the first crystal structures for the HhaI methyltransferase led to the discovery of base flipping. Bioinformatic studies of microbial genomes to find new restriction systems are a major research focus as is the elucidation of DNA methyltransferase recognition sequences using SMRT sequencing and a new approach to elucidating m5C-containing recognition sequences. It is now clear that these enzymes do much more than simply protect host DNA from the action of their restriction enzymes. Since winning the Nobel Prize, Dr. Roberts has been involved in organizing a number of Nobel initiatives to correct scientific misunderstandings and promote humanitarian causes. His most recent campaign has been on the issue of GMOs, where 160 Nobel Laureates have supported the use of GMO techniques to improve plant breeding practices that could greatly help the developing world.",
